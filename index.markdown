## 18th International Symposium, Innsbruck, Austria 3-4 July 2025

The 18th HLPP symposium will be held as a two-day event, hosted by the [Computer Science Department](https://www.uibk.ac.at/informatik) of the [University of Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at) in Austria. It focuses on high-level parallel programming of multi-/many-core platforms, accelerator architectures, heterogeneous compute clusters, and highly parallel or distributed infrastructures.

HLPP serves as a forum for researchers and engineers in parallel computing, offering an excellent opportunity for scientists to present their latest ideas and findings in this challenging and ever-changing research field. We especially encouraged innovative approaches in parallel programming models and applications, high-level parallel languages, compilers, runtime systems, and programming tools for all classes of parallel machines.

Following the successful [2024 symposium in Pisa](https://hlpp2024.di.unipi.it/), HLPP 2025 aims to deliver an enriching conference experience in Innsbruck, featuring impactful research, constructive discussions, and valuable networking opportunities.

Further details about the HLPP 2025 conference will be shared in the coming months.
We look forward to welcoming you to the University of Innsbruck in 2025!
