# Call for Sponsorship

The HLPP symposium is a very well-recognized scientific event that brings together leading experts, researchers, and professionals from diverse fields to discuss scientific results and achievements related to parallel computing with a specific focus on high-level parallel programming approaches and methodologies. In preparation for the 18th HLPP in July 2025, we are looking for companies to sponsor the event. By partnering with HLPP 2025, your company will gain additional visibility and recognition among the scientific community and symposium participants.

We offer three sponsorship packages (Bronze, Silver, and Gold) to choose from, each with a unique set of benefits and opportunities. These packages include branding opportunities, options for exhibition space, free registration fees, and speaking slots. However, the local organizers are happy to work with you to create a customized package that meets your specific needs and objectives. We hope your company joins us in supporting scientific innovation and discovery at HLPP 2025. Your partnership will not only contribute to the success of the event but also demonstrate your commitment to supporting scientific knowledge and research.

## Sponsorship packages
 * **Bronze**: 500 Euro. It includes your company logo on the symposium website, and recognition during the opening and closing address.
 * **Silver**: 1000 Euro. Includes all features of the Bronze package plus one registration fee, and a poster presentation of the company products and latest innovations to the attendees.
 * **Gold**: 1500 Euro. Includes all features of the Silver package plus one additional registration fee, and a technical presentation to the attendees.

Please **[contact the organizers](mailto:philipp.gschwandtner@uibk.ac.at)** if you are interested in sponsoring HLPP 2025. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
HLPP 2025 Symposium Chairs
