HLPP'25 encourages submissions on topics related to all aspects of parallel
computing, with a focus on high-level programming of multi-/many-cores,
heterogeneous compute clusters, and highly parallel or distributed
infrastructures.

Authors of accepted research papers will be invited to submit their work to the
Springer-Nature International Journal of Parallel Programming (IJPP) Special
Issue of the HLPP 2025 symposium.

# Topics of Interest
 * High-level parallel/distributed programming models, libraries, tools
 * High-level parallel programming for heterogeneous platforms with HW accelerators
