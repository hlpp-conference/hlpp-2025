# Social Event & Dinner

The social event will take place on the first day of the symposium, July 3, 2025.
We will meet right in front of the √Ågnes-Heller-Haus at 15:45, and board public transport to the base station of the [Patscherkofelbahn](https://www.patscherkofelbahn.at/en), a cable car that will take us to the Patscherkofel mountain at 1965m altitude.
There, we will enjoy a dinner at "Das Kofel", with a stunning view over Innsbruck and the surrounding mountains.
